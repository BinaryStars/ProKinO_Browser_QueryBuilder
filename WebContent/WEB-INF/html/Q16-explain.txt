Find all reactions in which a specified kinase acts as either a reactant, a product or a catalyst.<br>
This example finds all reactions involving the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). By replacing the line:
<pre>
         filter(STR(?geneName) = 'EGFR')
</pre>
with:
<pre>
         filter(STR(?geneName) = 'BRAF')
</pre>
we instead find all reactions involving the serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf (BRAF).
