Find the counts of wild type arginine mutations for each kinase, in descending order.<br>
This example finds mutations with arginine as the wild type amino acid altered. By replacing the line:
<pre>
        filter(STR(?wt) = 'R')
</pre>
with:
<pre>
        filter(STR(?wt) = 'S')
</pre>
we instead find mutations with serine as the wild type amino acid altered.
