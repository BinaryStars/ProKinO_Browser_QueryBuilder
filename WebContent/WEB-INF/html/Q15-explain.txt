Find all missense mutations that occur in a specified sequence or structural motif.<br>
In this example, we find all mutations located in the hydrophobic regulatory spine (Regulatory Spine). By replacing the line:
<pre>
        filter(STR(?mname) = 'Regulatory Spine')
</pre>
with:
<pre>
        filter(STR(?mname) = 'DFG Motif')
</pre>
we instead find all the mutations located in the DFG Motif. Likewise, any defined sequence or structural motif can be used.
