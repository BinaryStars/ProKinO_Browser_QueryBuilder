Find all the missense mutations that alter an arginine in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).<br>
This example finds mutations involving the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). By replacing the line:
<pre>
         filter(STR(?geneName) = 'EGFR')
</pre>
with:
<pre>
         filter(STR(?geneName) = 'BRAF')
</pre>
we instead find mutations involving the serine/threonine protein
kinase B-raf (BRAF). Furthermore, this example finds mutations with arginine as the wild type amino acid altered. By replacing the line:
<pre>
         filter(STR(?wt) = 'R')
</pre>
with:
<pre>
         filter(STR(?wt) = 'S')
</pre>
we instead find mutations with serine as the wild type amino acid altered.
