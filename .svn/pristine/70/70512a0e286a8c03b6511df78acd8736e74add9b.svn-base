  		  <p>The Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO), is a protein kinase-specific
	  	  ontology, which provides a controlled vocabulary of terms, their
		  hierarchy, and relationships unifying sequence, structure, function,
		  mutation and pathway information on kinases. 
		  The conceptual representation of such diverse information in one place
		  enables not only rapid discovery of significant information related to
		  a specific protein kinase, but also enables  large scale integrative
		  analysis of the protein kinase family.
		  <p>
		  ProKinO is a collaborative effort between the Evolutionary Systems 
                  Biology Group Lab of Dr. Natarajan Kannan at the Biochemistry and Molecular 
		  Biology Department and Dr. Krys J. Kochut's lab at the Computer Science Department,
		  both at University of Georgia, Athens, USA.  Gurinder Gosal, also at
		  UGA, created the software system to automatically populate ProKinO from the 
		  selected data sources.  The population system has
                  been modified and is currently maintained by Shima
                  Dastgheib, Computer Science, UGA.

		  <strong>Disease Data</strong> 
		  <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/" target="_blank">COSMIC</a>
		  (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database
		  is used as the source of information regarding kinase cancer mutations. In
		  addition to mutations, other information such as, the primary sites,
		  histology, samples, description and other relevant features is also
		  obtained from COSMIC.<br>
		  <p>The mutation data was obtained from the Sanger Institute Catalogue Of
		  Somatic Mutations In Cancer web site, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic
		  Bamford et al (2004) The COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in
		  Cancer) database and website. Br J Cancer, 91,355-358.
		  </p>

		  <strong>Pathway and Reaction Data</strong> 
		  The pathway and reaction data in ProKinO is obtained from 
		  <a href="http://www.reactome.org" target="_blank">Reactome</a>.
		  <p>Reactome project. http://www.reactome.org/ (26th January 2011).
		  </p>

		  <strong>Function Data</strong> 
		  The information regarding functional domains and functional
		  features associated with kinase domains is obtained from 
		  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/" target="_blank">UniProt</a>. The
		  information regarding the functional domains associated with kinase
		  domains, the crystal structures solved for each kinase domain,
		  isoforms, and functional features associated with kinases, such as
		  the modified residue, signal peptide, topological domain, cellular
		  location and tissue specificity, are obtained from UniProt.

		  </p>

		  <strong>Kinase Sub-domain Data</strong> 
		  To capture the sub-domain information in ProKinO, we have used a
		  motif model [1, 2] with key motifs corresponding to each of the
		  sub-domains in the kinase domain [3].

		  Current version: 1.0
		  <p>You can use this ontology browser to quickly locate protein kinase
		  genes and a lot of information related to the genes, including
		  the sequence, structure, function, mutation and pathway information on
		  kinases.
		  <p>You may initiate ProKinO browsing by selecting one of the following
		  items in the <strong>Browse</strong> menu:
		  <ul>
		   <li><strong>Organisms</strong>, which provides the list of organisms; 
		   select an organism of interest and click on it to display the kinase genes for the
		   organism.  Subsequently, you can select and click one of the genes to explore.</li>
		   <li><strong>Genes</strong>, which provides the list
		   of kinase genes for many organisms; select a gene
		   of interest and click on it to display the gene data.</li>
		   <li><strong>Kinase Domains</strong>, which provides the hierarchy all kinase domains; 
		   you will be able to expand the groups into families and subfamilies,
		   eventually finding the domains; again, select one of interest and
		   click on it to display the kinase domain information.</li>
		   <li><strong>Diseases</strong>, which provides the list of all diseases (limited to
		   cancers at this time) that are affected by kinase genes; select
		   one of interest and click on it to display the cancer data.</li>
		   <li><strong>Functional Domains</strong>, which provides the list of all functional
		   domains; again, you may select one of interest and click on it to display the
		   functional domain data.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
		  The <strong>Query</strong> functionality for Genes,
		  Diseases, and Pathways is not available at this
		  time, but we are working on providing it as soon as
		  possible.  However, arbitrary SPARQL queries can be
		  submitted (the size of the resulting set is limited
		  to 1500, at this time).
		  <p>
		  The ProKinO ontology has not been released for downloading, yet.
		  <p>
		  After you initiate ProKinO browsing by selecting and displaying the data 
		  information page for one of the genes, kinase domains, diseases, or functional domains,
		  you will be able to explore the ontology by activating the hyper-links 
		  leading to a variety of related data.
		  <p>Usually, a data information page includes the properties of the shown
		  entity (for example, cellular location or tissue specificity of
		  the genes), and links to other related ontology entities (for example, 
		  functional domains, sequences, pathways of the
		  genes).

		  <p>The gene data is subdivided into sub-areas, including the general
		  information, functional features, mutations, pathways, and external
		  references.  These sub-areas of information are available by
		  clicking on the provided tabs.  The mutations are further subdivided
		  into substitutions, insertions, deletions, complex mutations, and
		  other.
